## üåü Overview
This project focuses on **time series analysis** using the stock data of **H√≤a Ph√°t Group (HPG)** from **2010 to 2024**. The analysis involves:
- Decomposing the stock price data
- Checking for stationarity and correlations
- Forecasting future prices using ARIMA models
- Exploring data splitting techniques: **Expanding Window** and **Sliding Window**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the environment, install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Data Decomposition:
- The stock price data was decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components for better analysis.
2. Stationarity Check:
- The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was applied to check the stationarity of the data.
3. ARIMA Model:
- Fitted an ARIMA model on 80% of the data for training, followed by model evaluation and forecasting.
4. Expanding and Sliding Window Techniques:
- Compared the model performance using both Expanding Window and Sliding Window techniques.
5. Forecasting:
- Predicted future stock prices using the trained ARIMA model.
- ADF test results.
- Forecast vs. actual stock prices.
- Model performance comparisons for Expanding and Sliding Window splits.
